Nuperus offers simple yet elegant way to aggregate all your favorite RSS channels in one place. You can add any RSS channel you want in a very intuitive way so you can fully tailor your experience according to your needs.

If you are tired of curated social media feeds and sites with feeds that don't show most recent content but instead show what they deem important, this is an app for you.

"Nuperus" is latin for "recent" and it stays true to its name meaning it shows content as it comes, latest content will be shown to you as it is uploaded.

RSS as technology offers many possibilities so for instance, you can even add RSS feeds of your favorite YouTube channels so you can stay up to date with their newest uploads AND various other content, all from one place!

Add color to each channel to organize them as you see fit.

Supports both light and dark theme.
